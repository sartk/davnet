Things to work on before next meeting

* Discriminator on all intermediate features
Function that does the global average pooling, and automatically detects the kernel size. - done

    - ^^ compare above if it doesn't work to multiple discriminators

- Memory Loss - if this gets fixed: good
    - if it doesn't get fixed: split all_source across multiple epochs?

- Per class dice as a metric

- Segmentation warm up (refer Kamnitsas) - done

- Changing the weights?

- Maximum density divergence (if anything is applicable in our problem)
