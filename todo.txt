Things to work on before next meeting

* Blind target segmentations in training (unsupervised)
* Try the domain classifier on decoder
* 


input image ---> vnet encoder (domain) --->  vnet decoder ---> seg

input image ---> vnet encoder  --->  vn (domain) et (domain) de (domain) coder ---> seg

input layers (self supervised task (like edge detection)) ---> vnet encoder (domain) --->  vnet decoder ---> seg



"""
* Discriminator on all intermediate features
Function that does the global average pooling, and automatically detects the kernel size. - done

    - ^^ compare above if it doesn't work to multiple discriminators

- Memory Loss - if this gets fixed: good
    - if it doesn't get fixed: split all_source across multiple epochs?

- Per class dice as a metric - done

- Segmentation warm up (refer Kamnitsas) - done

- Changing the weights?

- Maximum density divergence (if anything is applicable in our problem)
